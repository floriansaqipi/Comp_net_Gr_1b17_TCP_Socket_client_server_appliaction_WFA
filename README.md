### Readme File - Computer Networks Project

## Project Overview

This project was developed as the second assignment for the Computer Networks course. The main objective was to implement a client-server application using C# and socket programming. The application is designed as a Windows Form App and fulfills specific requirements outlined below.

### Project Requirements

#### Server
1. **Variable Setup:**
   - Define variables to store the port number (any valid port) and the IP address.

2. **Listening:**
   - Enable the server to listen for incoming connections from all group members.

3. **Request Handling:**
   - Accept requests from devices and execute at least one request for each group member.

4. **Message Handling:**
   - Read and process messages sent by clients.

5. **Access Control:**
   - Provide full access to at least one client for folders and content/files on the server.

#### Client
1. **Socket Connection:**
   - Establish a socket connection with the server.

2. **Privileges:**
   - Grant one of the devices (clients) write(), read(), and execute() privileges.
   - Restrict other clients to only have read() permission.

3. **Server Connection:**
   - Establish a connection with the server by specifying the correct port and IP address.

4. **Socket Definition:**
   - Clearly define server socket and ensure successful connections.

5. **Response Handling:**
   - Read and interpret responses received from the server.

6. **Message Sending:**
   - Send messages to the server in text form.

7. **Full Access:**
   - Allow full access to folders and content/files on the server.
